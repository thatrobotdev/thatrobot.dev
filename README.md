Hello! My name is JP! I'm not exactly sure what's going to be here in the future. Something cool, I hope ðŸ˜„
thatrobotdev is my online alias, and I use it frequently under my work.

If you want to look at what I am doing currently, you can check out my twitter [@JamesKerrane](https://twitter.com/JamesKerrane), or my scrapbook at [scrapbook.jameskerrane.com](https://scrapbook.jameskerrane.com) where I am posting what I am currently making this summer.

Thank you! ðŸ˜„
